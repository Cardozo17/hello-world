# hello-world
My first repository, I used it to learn a little bit about GitHub, and to publish random stuffs.
If I get a new intresting idea in which I desire start working on, I am going to post it in this repository.

I am a systems engineering student in the Universidad de los Andes, MÃ©rida. Venezuela
